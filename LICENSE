CODE:
You can do what you want we don't care but if something doesn't work for you don't blame us.

MODEL COMMERCIAL USAGE:
The model was trained with the CelebA dataset. The authors of this dataset do not allow
for commercial usage. Therefore, we (authors of this repo) only allow for commercial
usage of source code. You can modify it, train your own head segmentation models,
and whatever else you want with it, but we do not grand a commercial license for the model
usage which we are providing by default with the repo.
Please be fair 🤗😉.
